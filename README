Example of non-blocking streams
-------------------------------

Code makes several http connections to a script which sleeps for a random period of time before responding.
Traditional blocking sockets would wait for each request to finish before moving on to the next.
However, these connections are configured not to block, so they will return immediately after accessing the stream with whatever data that is waiting.
The script demonstrates the asynchronous behaviour by showing that the order of the responses is not necessarily the order of the requests


Instructions
------------

Copy web/random-sleep.php to your local webroot so it's accessible at http://127.0.0.1:random-sleep.php
You don't have to put it there but request details will need changing.

Run

php ./scripts/async-http.php
